% 1) Porosity = 1 ensures that the domain is solid throughout in the equations
% 2) Specific gravities are not used anywhere in the code implementation - set to zero
% 3) The biot co-efficient is mapped to the effect of diffusion-induced stresses and it's applied as a one-way coupling (the other term of biot coefficient in SinglePhaseFlow is eliminated from the discretizer)
