<BCentities>
Various attribute are available to specify the
ID of the constrained entities in different ways.

'bcListFile'
a path to a list of entities ID of type entitiyType
(see the BoundaryConditions tutorial)

'surfaceTags'
the surfaceTags to which the constrained entities belong

'bcList'
a simple list of entities to be constrained in the specified components

NOTE
for the case of multi-component fields where 'bcList' or 'surfaceTags'
are used, the user must also specify the 'component' attribute
component = "x" or component = "x,y,z" or component = "y,z"



<BCevent>
Each BC event needs a 'time' and a 'value' attribute

'time' can be:
a single scalar
a function handle of a scalar multiplier changing with time (t)

'valuel can be:
a single scalar (constant in space for each dof),
a path to a file with a list of values for each dof
a function handle depending on space (x,y,z)
